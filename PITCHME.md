## Laser Cutter

* Uses laser to burn material away
* Computer-controlled
* Very safe if used correctly

Note:
Do quick earring demo
---

# Safety

Even a safe tool should be used with respect

---

## Safe Use

* Wear safety glasses
* Check lid safety interlock
* Have a fire extinguisher nearby
* Use only appropriate materials
* Never leave laser cutting unsupervised

Note:
* Safety glasses -> polycarb -> block laser
* Fire extinguisher should be CO2 to avoid damage
* Come back to appropriate materials later

---

# Creating a Design

+++

## Software

* Any vector software
  * Inkscape
  * Illustrator
  * Gravit
* Simple designs can be created in RetinaEngrave (software on laser)

+++

## Engraving & Cutting

* Engraving/rastering is burning an image onto the surface of the material
  * Can use ordinary image files
  * Grayscale
* Vector cutting is following the outline of a shape
  * Usually used to cut through
  * Can be done lightly for an engraving
  * Can only be done with a vector shape

+++

## Vector & Raster

* Vectors are **outlines** and have a clear outline - they can be cut
* Rasters are **bitmaps** and have no clear outline - they can only be engraved

+++

## Preparing Your File

* Use different colored lines to be able to have different settings
* Muse can process most image files for engraving, but JPG is recommended
* For anything involving vector cutting, PDF files are prefered
 
---

## Connect to Laser

* Use an ethernet cable to connect
* go to the address shown on the Muse screen

---

## Import Design

Go to File > Open and choose yoru file

---

## Place Material

## Focus & Scan Material

+++

#### Focus

* Place billet on the material
* Loosen the focus lens screw
* Let laser move gently down to billet
* Retighten screw

+++

## Scan 

Use the camera icon on the built-in screen to scan the work area

---

## Alignment

Make sure design is placed correctly on material

---

## Settings

* Select objects and use property tab to adjust parameters
* Will demonstrate

---

## Lasers!

* Make sure the air filter and chiller are running
* Use the start/play button to start cutting
* Make sure you watch the laser!
* Use the built-in emergency stop if needed
